\section{Overview}

\subsubsection{Chapter 1}
This dissertation is a literature study to investigate the validity of different linear models for beams and plates. The term validity in this dissertation means how well a model compares to a more realistic model for real world applications. The first chapter of the dissertation introduces the models. The simplest model is the Timoshenko model. The other models are a two-dimensional elastic beam model, three-dimensional elastic beam and plate models and a Reissner-Mindlin plate model. The aim in this dissertation to validate the use of the Timoshenko beam model and the Reissner-Mindlin plate model in applications. These models are simplified one-dimensional beam and two-dimensional plate models. But more realistic models exists, such as a two-dimensional and three-dimensional beam model and a three-dimensional plate model. Using modal analysis (see Chapter 2), it is shown that the solutions of the models can be represented as a linear combination of the modal solutions. Using this idea, it is only required to compare the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the models to be able to compare the difference between the solutions. In Chapter 1, the models of the dissertation are given (in dimensionless form).  Model problems are then defined by including boundary conditions. These model problems are the models used in the rest of the dissertation. The variational forms are also derived which enables us to see the similarity between the models and the general theory.

\subsubsection{Chapter 2}
First, a variational form for a model problem of a cantilever Timoshenko beam is given. This model problem in variational form is then extended to complete function spaces, and a weak variational problem is obtained. This weak variational problem is used as an example to explain the main theory of this chapter which is from the article \cite{VV02}. In this article, the authors present a general weak variational form. The weak variational form of all the model problems of this dissertation are special cases of this general weak variational problem. Therefore the assumptions and results can be formulated and applied to all the applications in this dissertation. The article gives four assumptions. Under these assumptions it is shown that the general vibration problem has a unique solution using semi-group theory. The theory is then applied to the example by proving that the assumptions hold.

Finally the concept of modal analysis is introduced, which is fundamental to this dissertation. First idea of modal analysis is explained by hands of another example, again using a cantilever Timoshenko beam. Then the general case is discussed that follows the article \cite{CVV18}. Given a general vibration problem, it is split into two problems by introducing a trial solution. It can then be verified that these two problems are the eigenvalue problem and an ordinary differential equation. An additional assumption (additional to the assumptions of \cite{VV02}) is introduced by \cite{CVV18}. Under this assumption, the eigenvalue problem has a complete orthonormal sequence of eigen-solutions. The solution of the general vibration problem is an infinite series of modal solutions. This formal series solution is then shown to also be valid for a initial value problem. This general case is also applicable to all the models in this dissertation.

This theory is crucial for this dissertation. It ensures that the solutions of the models will compare well if the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions compare well. Therefore for the comparisons in Chapter 4 and 6, it is only required to compare the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. The validity of the formal series solution is also important as it ensures that the comparisons remain valid, as long as the models are disturbed in the same way.

\subsubsection{Chapter 3}
In this chapter, some theory for the Finite Element Method is discussed. This chapter contains two parts, that covers two different theoretical results. The first is on the convergence of the Galerkin approximation of a general vibration problem. This theory is presented in the article \cite{BV13}. The second part concerns the convergence of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a vibration problem when applying the Finite Element Method. This theory is presented in the textbook \cite{SF73}. 

In the first part, the authors of \cite{BV13} consider the general vibration problem that is studied in Chapter 2. The general vibration problem has a solution as shown in Chapter 2. The Galerkin Approximation is derived from the general vibration problem and is rewritten into a system of ordinary differential using the Finite Element Method. This ordinary differential equation can be proven to have a unique solution. The main results of \cite{BV13} shows that this solution of the Galerkin Approximation converges to the solution of the general vibration problem. The approach of the authors is to calculate the error estimates.

The second part of the chapter considers work done in a textbook \cite{SF73} on eigenvalue problems for elliptic partial differential equations. The specific work discussed, covers the convergence of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a general vibration problem when applying the Finite Element Method. The authors consider a general eigenvalue problem. Then using the Rayleigh-quotient, from the Rayleigh-Ritz method, as well as an approximation theorem from \cite{OR76}, the main result is proven. The specific work done in this section is updating the notation of the textbook, as well as expanding some proofs so that the results are easier to understand.

\subsubsection{Chapter 4}
This chapter is a focus on the main theory of this dissertation, the Timoshenko beam theory. The first section is a discussion of modal analysis applied to the Timoshenko beam theory, and specifically a discussion of the article \cite{VV06}. In this article, the authors present a method to calculate the exact eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a Timoshenko beam. Starting with a general eigenvalue problem for a Timoshenko beam model, the authors derive a general solution for the ordinary differential equation. The authors then explain the method by hands of an example by applying the method to a cantilever beam model. The next sections of this chapter also then looks at examples of applying the method, first to a cantilever beam model, and then to a pinned-pinned beam model.

Section 4.5 is a discussion of the article \cite{LVV09}. In this article, the authors investigate the validity of a cantilever Timoshenko beam model, by comparing it to a two-dimensional cantilever Timoshenko beam model. The authors compare the models by comparing the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. (See Chapter 2 on modal analysis). The two-dimensional model is more complex and there are eigenvalues that are not shared between the models. The authors use the mode shapes to match up the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues matching the eigenvalues of the Timoshenko beam model are referred to by the authors as beam-type eigenvalues. The authors also consider different shapes of beams, from a short thick beam to a long slender beam. The results show that the models compare very well, even for a short and thick beam.

The next section is a discussion on the article \cite{SP06}. In this article, the authors investigate the validity of the Timoshenko beam theory, by comparing the eigenvalues (natural frequencies) for a physical beam, to a Timoshenko beam and a three-dimensional beam using Finite Element Analysis. The authors report on an experiment with forced vibration a free-free beam where the natural frequencies are measured. These empirical results are then compared to the theoretical results. This result, together with the results in chapter 6, give a good picture to the validity of the Timoshenko beam theory.

\subsubsection{Chapter 5}
In this chapter, the Finite Element Method is applied to cantilever two-dimensional elastic body, cantilever three-dimensional elastic body and a cantilever Reissner-Mindlin plate. The aim of this section is to obtain an algorithm to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the models. The Finite Element Method is not applied to the Timoshenko beam theory, as chapter 4 provides an alternative method. For all the models, the Finite Element Method is applied using bi-cubic or tri-cubic basis functions to improve the rate of convergence and reduce the processing required to obtain accurate results. Each section ends with a eigenvalue problem for the models that can be easily applied to a computer program to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the models. This is in preparation of Chapter 6 where the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are calculated and compared.

\subsubsection{Chapter 6}
This chapter is an extension of the work of Section 4.5. In Section 4.5, the validity of the Timoshenko beam theory is investigated by comparing a Timoshenko beam model to a two-dimensional beam model. 

In real-world applications, a beam is a three-dimensional model. Therefore it should be more realistic to use a three-dimensional model to investigate the validity of the Timoshenko beam theory. This is mentioned by the authors of \cite{LVV09}. Their suggestion is to use the two-dimensional model as an intermediate step, to avoid complexities. Therefore the validity of the two-dimensional model is investigated, using a three-dimensional beam model as a reference. Again the results so that the comparison relies on the shape of the beams. The two-dimensional model compares well to the three-dimensional beam if the beam is not wide. 

If the width of the beam is very large, the use of a beam model can be questioned. A plate model might be more suited. Therefore the last section of this chapter investigates the validity of the Reissner-Mindlin plate model. The Reissner-Mindlin plate model is compared to a three-dimensional plate model. The results show that the Reissner-Mindlin plate model compares well to the three-dimensional plate model.

The same method is used in this chapter as in Section 4.5. The mode shapes are sketched and matched. The corresponding eigenvalues can then be matched up and compared. The eigenvalues relating to the Reissner-Mindlin plate model are referred to as plate-type eigenvalues.

\section{Achievements}

In the first chapter, the models of this dissertation are presented and a dimensionless variational form for each is derived. The model problems for this dissertation are then formulated.

In the second chapter, two results are investigated. This first is on the existence and uniqueness of solutions for vibration problems. An article is discussed that proves the existence and uniqueness of solutions for a general vibration problem using semi-group theory and assuming four assumptions. All the models in this dissertation is a special case of this general problem, so the theory can be explained and applied to an example. The weak variational form for a cantilever Timoshenko beam is derived. In this derivation, we also give the definitions of the spaces required. The theory is then applied to this example problem. We show that the four assumptions can be proven to be true for the cantilever Timoshenko beam model.

The next result is in Modal Analysis. Again the cantilever Timoshenko beam model is used to first explain the theory, before the general case is discussed. A trial solution is presented and substituted into the partial differential equations. This results into two problems, an eigenvalue problem and an ordinary differential equation. These two problems are solved and substitution can confirm then that the trial solutions are indeed solutions. The method obtains the same result as separation of variables, but avoids any division. Finally a formal series solution for the example is given. The general case is then discussed and follows the same idea. Modal analysis is crucial for this dissertation. For the comparisons later in this dissertation, a method is required to compare the different models. Modal analysis shows that is the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the models compare well, then the solutions of the models should compare well. And since the Fourier Coefficients gets small very fast, it is only required to look at the first few eigenvalues.

In the third chapter, two theoretical results for the Finite Element Method is discussed. The first result is on the convergence of the Galerkin Approximation. The general case contains various symbols rectangularly used in application, so an example of the cantilever Timoshenko beam model is used and the Galerkin Approximation is derived. Then the general case is discussed from an article. The results from the article are presented in a reduced format to avoid introducing too many new symbols. We also present the results in four new Theorems, to present the results of the article in a concise manner.

The second result is on the convergence of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions when using the Finite Element Method. The results are presented in textbook. Here we use the notation of the dissertation to present the results. The results are also expanded in an attempt to better explain the theory, with a few new parameters also introduced.

In the fourth chapter, we investigate our simplest model, the Timoshenko beam theory. First is a discussion of an article that provides a method that allows us to find the exact eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a Timoshenko beam model. A summary of this method is presented. It is then applied to two model problems for a cantilever Timoshenko beam and a free-free Timoshenko beam. For both model problems, the method is applied and examples of the eigenvalues and mode shapes are given. The eigenvalues and mode shape plots are obtained using a computer program, sketching the equation of motion and the using interval division to get the eigenvalues to a desired level of accuracy. This is in preparation for the comparison results in the results that follow.  




In the fourth chapter, we look at our simplest model, the Timoshenko beam model. The first result discusses an article that provides a method to determine the exact eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the Timoshenko beam model. We then apply this to a cantilever beam model and a free-free beam model to obtain the eigenvalues and plot the mode shapes. We then look at an article that compares a cantilever Timoshenko beam model to a two-dimensional beam model. We discuss the results of the article and replicate the results with more significant digits. We also include some more results not included in the article, that are used later in Chapter 6. We then look at another article that compares the Timoshenko beam theory to results obtained from a measured beam. The authors suspended a beam on both ends an vibrated the beam until then endpoints could be considered free. They then swept through different frequencies and recorded the natural frequencies of the beam. These results are then compared to the theoretical results of a free-free Timoshenko beam. We add to the article by giving the model problems for the beams and discuss the results.

The fifth chapter is a preparation chapter for the comparisons of this dissertation. In chapter 4, we have a method to obtain the exact eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the Timoshenko beam theory. But a different approach is required for the two- and three-dimensional models. In this chapter, we derive the Galerkin Approximation for each of the models. We then define a discrete grid of elements on the reference configuration on each of the models. Then using piece-wise Hermite cubic basis functions, we derive a matrix representation of the model problems using the standard Finite Element Analysis. In this form it is then easy to obtain a matrix representation of the eigenvalue problem for each of the models. This is in preparation for the comparisons of the models in Section 4.5 as well as chapter 6.

In the final chapter, we extend the work of Section 4.5 and investigate the validity of the two-dimensional beam model as well as the validity of the Reissner-Mindlin plate model. Using the work from chapter 5, a numerical formula is derived to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the models. This is implemented into some MATLAB code. (This was also done to obtain the results in Section 4.5). The same structure as Section 4.5 is followed. To start, the mode shapes are calculated and plotted. These are then compared so that the eigenvalues can be matched up. Careful consideration should be taken to the shapes as there are many shapes not relating to beam-type or plate-type problems. The results show that the shape of the models impact how well the models compare. The cases of the comparisons were chosen so that they represent realistic scenarios for use in application.


\section{Future Work}



\end{document}


\section{500-word summary}
This dissertation is a literature study that investigates the validity of different linear models in application. Validity in this context refers to how well simplified lower dimensional models compare to more realistic higher dimensional models. This dissertation will investigate the validity of the Timoshenko beam theory and the Reissner-Mindlin plate theory. The higher dimensional models are a two- and three-dimensional beam and a three-dimensional plate. The models are provided in the first chapter

Next, a discussion of the existence and uniqueness of solutions for a general vibration problem. The article discussed provide four assumptions, and prove there exists an infinitesimal generator of a $C_0$-semigroup of contractions, that rewrites the problem into an initial value problem, with a unique solution. The authors then prove this is also a solution of the general vibration problem. An application of this theory is demonstrated using a cantilever Timoshenko beam. \textcolor{red}{Modal analysis is crucial to this dissertation. We show that the solution of the general vibration problem is a linear combination of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. This is the foundation of the comparisons of the models in this dissertation.}

Thereafter a discussion of two theoretical results for the Finite Element Method. The first result is from an article where the convergence of the Galerkin Approximation is proved. \sout{A Galerkin Approximation of the general vibration problem is derived.} Using the Finite Element Method, this Galerkin Approximation is rewritten into an initial value problem, that has a unique solution. The authors show that there exists error estimates that approximate the error between the general vibration problem and the initial value problem. The next result is from a textbook on the convergence of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a one-dimensional vibration problem. This is based of work done in a textbook, but the notation is updated and some proofs are expanded.

The forth chapter discusses results for the Timoshenko beam theory. First an article is examined that provides a method to calculate the exact eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The method is then applied to a cantilever and a free-free beam model. \textcolor{red}{Thereafter, the validity of the Timoshenko beam theory is investigated, by comparing a Timoshenko beam model to a two-dimensional beam model. The comparison is made by comparing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.} Next is a discussion of an empirical study, that compares the natural frequencies of a physical free-free beam to the theoretical results of the Timoshenko beam theory. \sout{Finally an extension on a technical report of a cantilever Timoshenko beam with a tip-body and elastic interfaces. This model serves as an example of the application of the Timoshenko theory in a complex model and adds to the article by expanding the numerical results.}

In the fifth chapter, the Finite Element Method is applied to the two and three-dimensional models of this dissertation. The goal of this chapter is to obtain a numerical formula \textcolor{red}{to solve the eigenvalue problems,} \sout{that can be used to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the models in} preparation for the final chapter where the models are compared.

The last chapter extends the numerical results of the dissertation to a comparison of a two-dimensional model to a three-dimensional beam model and a comparison of a Reissner-Mindlin plate model to a three-dimensional plate model.

\section{Overview}

\subsubsection{Comparison of models}
The first chapter introduces the models used in this dissertation. The models are of different dimensions. The first model is a three dimensional elastic body. The model problems for the three-dimensional body is a cantilever and a free-free body. A general case of plane stress is also discussed. Making assumptions on plane stress, results into a two-dimensional model. This model is a special case of plane stress. For the one-dimensional case, the Timoshenko beam theory is considered. Four different models problems are used in this dissertation. These model problems are a cantilever, a free-free beam, a pinned-pinned beam and a suspended beam. Lastly a Reissner Mindlin plate theory is considered. The model problems for the plate theory are a cantilever plate and a rigidly clamped plate. For each of the models problems, the boundary conditions are presented and the variational form is derived. The variational form of each problem is mainly used in this dissertation. (ROD THEORY?)

\subsubsection{Mathematical analysis of vibration problems}

This chapter is a discussion and example of application of the theory presented in the article \cite{VV02}. This article concerns the existence and uniqueness of solutions of second order hyperbolic type problems. The models in this dissertation are such problems. In the article \cite{VV02}, the authors define a general variational problem on specific Hilbert spaces. To obtain the main results of the article, four assumptions are made. The results include existence and uniqueness of solutions for strong and weak damped models. The models in this dissertation are all weakly damped. The general variational problem is rewritten for a first order system of differential equations. This system is defined on a Hilbert space $H$. A operator $A$ is defined, and using the assumptions the authors prove that the operator $A$ is an infinitesimal generator of a $C_0$-semigroup of contractions with a domain in $H$. Using this operator the authors rewrite the system of differential into the form $\displaystyle x' = Ax + f$. To be more precise, the system of first order system of differential equations can be written as an initial value problem. The existence and uniqueness results for the first order system is easily proven with an initial value problem. The authors also prove that a solution of the first order system is also a solution to the general variational problem. Using semi-group theory, a unique solution for the initial value problem can be proved. The authors also provide the link between the solutions of the initial value problem and the general variational form. Thus proving the required results. As an example to apply the theory, a cantilever Timoshenko beam is used. The weak variational form is derived. In this weak variational form, the product spaces can be made complete. The four assumptions of \cite{VV02} is then proved to hold for the example. (Modal Analysis ?)

\subsubsection{Finite element theory}

In this chapter, two convergence results relating to the Finite Element Method are discussed. The first result is the convergence of the Galerkin approximation for vibration problems. This is presented in the article \cite{BV13.} For this result, the general variational form of Chapter 2 is used. The Galerkin approximation of this general variational problem can be derived, as well as an initial value problem using the standard Finite Element Analysis matrices. The article \cite{BV13} derive an error estimate for the solution of the general varitat problem and the solution to it's Galerkin approximation. To obtain this error estimate, the authors make two assumptions, and split the problem into a semi-discrete and a fully discrete problem. Following the assumptions, the authors prove error estimates for the semi-dicrete and the fully-discrete problem.\\ 

The second result concerns the convergence of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions with the Finite Element Method for one-dimensional vibration problems. This is a result form the textbook \cite{SF73}.**********


\subsubsection{Timoshenko beam model}

Tis chapter explores the idea of the Timoshenko beam theory further. The article \cite{VV06} presents a method of finding the exact eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for a Timoshenko beam. The method uses modal analysis to solve a general eigenvalue problem. This results in three different cases of possible solutions for the general eigenvalue problem. Using these cases, the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be calculated. The authors also present some examples. Two examples are verified in this chapter. The cantilever and free-free beam. For both the eigenvalues are calculated and compared to the results of \cite{VV06}. Some examples of modal shapes are also graphed. The idea of a suspended beam is breifly discussed. Next the article \cite{SP06} is discussed. In this section, the authors obtain eigenvalues of a free-free Timoshenko beam by vibrating and measuring the natural frequencies of a real beam. This empirical data is then compared to the theoretical results of various methods, including the Finite Element Method. In this last section, a example of the application of the Timoshenko beam model is presented. This section is a study of a technical report. In this report, the authors present a model for a cantilever Timoshenko beam with a tip body and elastic interfaces. This section also expands the numerical results of the report. The variational form of the model is derived, and the Galerkin approximation follows. The Mixed Finite Element Method is applied to the model. Using the Finite Element Method, the solution of the model is numerically calculated. Various results are given for different values of the parameters. The numerical results and figures confirms that the model behaves as expected. 

\subsubsection{Finite element method}
This chapter is preperation for the final chapter in this dissertation. The finite element method is applied to the models of this dissertation. Specifically, it is applied to the Cantilever model problem of the three-dimensional and two-dimensional elastic bosies, as well as the cantilever plate model. The cantilever Timoshenko beam model is excluded since chapter 4 provides an exact method to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Each of the models are assumed to have a rectangular cross-section and is made of the same isotropic material. For each model, a reference configuration is defined. The Galerkin approximation can then be derived and using the Finite Element Method, a system of ordinary differential equations can be obtained. At this point is it easy to derive a eigenvalue problem for each of the models. This eigenvalue problem can be solved using numerical methods.

\subsubsection{Validity of cantilever beam and plate models}

In this chapter, the validity of the models in this dissertation is investigated using numerical results. Specifically the validity of a cantilever Timoshenko beam and a cantilever Reissner-Mindlin plate is investigated. In this case, the term validity refers to how well the model compares to a more realistic model. All models are assumed to have a rectangular cross-section, are in a cantilever configuration and are made of the same isotropic material. The first section, is a discussion of the article \cite{LVV09}. In this article, the authors investigate the validity of the Timoshenko beam model. The authors compare the Timoshenko beam model to a more realistic two-dimensional beam model. The comparison is made with the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. From modal analysis it is known that the solution of the models are linear combinations of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. The two-dimensional model also have eigenvalues that do not have a corresponding eigenvalue in the Timoshenko beam model. The authors call all matching eigenvalues beam-type eigenvalues. The authors show that the Timoshenko beam model compare well to the two-dimensional model for long and short beams. The results of the article are verified and extra results are also calculated for the rest of this chapter. In this section, the aricle \cite{LVV09} is extended to verify the validity of the two-dimensional elastic model. The two-dimensional elastic model is compared to a more realistic three-dimensional model. The two dimensional model serves as a intermediate step between the Timoshenko beam model and the three-dimensional model. The same approach of \cite{LVV09} is used to compare the two models. The result show that the two-dimensional model compare very well to the three-dimensional model, especially for beam problems. The last section takes the idea of \cite{LVV09} and extends it to the Reissner-Mindlin plate model. The Reissner-Mindlin plate model is compared to a more realistic three-dimensional plate model.\\

\section{Mathematical analysis of vibration problems}

This chapter is a discussion and example of application of the theory presented in the article \cite{VV02}. This article concerns the existence and uniqueness of solutions of second order hyperbolic type problems. The models in this dissertation as such problems.\\

This chapter also concerns the idea of modal analysis. This is a method to find the natural frequencies of a system. This method is used later in the dissertation.

\subsection{Existence and uniqueness of solutions}
This section is a discussion of the theory presented in the article \cite{VV02}.

\subsubsection{Main results for existence and uniqueness}
The main results of the article are given in this section. The results include existence and uniqueness of solutions for strong and weak damped models. The models in this dissertation are all weakly damped. 

\subsubsection{First order system}
To prove the results, the approach of the authors are as follows.\\

The general variational problem is rewritten for a first order system of differential equations. This system is defined on a Hilbert space $H$. A operator $A$ is defined, and using the assumptions the authors prove that the operator $A$ is an infinitesimal generator of a $C_0$-semigroup of contractions with a domain in $H$.\\

Using this operator the authors rewrite the system of differential into the form $\displaystyle x' = Ax + f$. To be more precise, the system of first order system of differential equations can be written as an initial value problem.\\

\section{Finite element theory}

\subsection{Convergence of the Galerkin approximation}
In this Chapter, two convergence results related to the Finite Element Method is presented. This first result is the convergence of the Galerkin approximation of a second order hyperbolic type problem, presented in the article \cite{BV13}.\\

The second result concerns the convergence of the eigenvalue and eigenfunctions of a one-dimensional second order hyperbolic type problem when applying the Finite Element Method. This is presented in the textbook \cite{SF73}.

\subsubsection{Galerkin approximation}
In this section, the authors use the same general variational problem as presented in \cite{VV02} (Chapter 2). The authors assume that this general variational problem has a unique solution.\\

To start, the Galerkin approximation for the general variational problem is derived. The a unique solution is proved in \cite{BV13} when the forcing function $f$ is continuous.\\

Using the Finite Element Method matrices, the Galerkin approximation is rewritten as a system of ordinary differential equations.

\subsubsection{Error estimates}
Given that $u$ is a solution of the general variational problem, and $u^h$ is a solution to the Galerkin approximation, the authors define the error $e^h = u - u^h$.\\

The in \cite{BV13} the authors prove that this error can be made arbitrarily small by choosing a sufficiently small $h$, such that $u^h \rightarrow u$ as $h \rightarrow 0$. \cite{BSV17} extends \cite{BV13} to include damping.\\


To obtain the error estimate, the authors split the error into two parts. The first part is a semi-dicrete problem and the second is a discrete problem. These two problems are investigated seperately.

This chapter is preperation for the final chapter in this dissertation. The finite element method to a cantilever version of each of the models in this dissertation. The goal of the chapter is to get a numerical formula to solve the eigenvalue problem for each model. The Timoshenko beam model is excluded from this chapter since an exact methd is already presented in chapter 4 (\cite{VV02}).\\

\subsection{Two-dimensional cantilever body}

The model is assumed to have a rectangular cross-section and is in a cantilever configuration. The Galerkin approximation is derived and applying the finite element method, a numerical formula for solving the model problem is given.\\

In this numerical formula, the model problem is a system of linear equations. This system can be changed to obtain a numerical formula for teh eigenvalue problem.\\


\subsection{Three-dimensional elastic model}
Similar to above.

\subsection{Cantilever plate model}
Similar to above.

\section{Validity of cantilever beam and plate models}

In this chapter, the validity of the models in this dissertation is investigated using numerical results. Specifically the validity of a cantilever Timoshenko beam and a cantilever Reissner-Mindlin plate is investigated.\\

In this case, the term validity refers to how well the model compares to a more realistic model.\\

All models are assumed to have a rectangular cross-section, are in a cantilever configuration and are made of the same isotropic material.\\




\subsection{Validity of the Timoshenko beam model}
This first section, is a discussion of the article \cite{LVV09}. In this article, the authors investigate the validity of the Timoshenko beam model. The authors compare the Timoshenko beam model to a more realistic two-dimensional beam model.\\

The comparison is made with the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. From modal analysis it is known that the solution of the models are linear combinations of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.\\

The two-dimensional model also have eigenvalues that do not have a corresponding eigenvalue in the Timoshenko beam model. The authors call all matching eigenvalues beam-type eigenvalues.\\

The authors show that the Timoshenko beam model compare well to the two-dimensional model for long and short beams. The results of the article are verified and extra results are also calculated for the rest of this chapter.\\

\subsection{Validity of the two-dimensional elastic model}

In this section, the aricle \cite{LVV09} is extended to verify the validity of the two-dimensional elastic model. The two-dimensional elastic model is compared to a more realistic three-dimensional model.\\

The two dimensional model serves as a intermediate step between the Timoshenko beam model and the three-dimensional model.\\

The same approach of \cite{LVV09} is used to compare the two models. The result show that the two-dimensional model compare very well to the three-dimensional model, especially for beam problems.


\subsection{Validity of the Reissner-Mindlin plate model}

The last section takes the idea of \cite{LVV09} and extends it to the Reissner-Mindlin plate model. The Reissner-Mindlin plate model is compared to a more realistic three-dimensional plate model.\\

In chapter 1, word al die modelle gegee wat in die dissertation gebruik word. Die modelle word in dimenielose form herskryf. Die modelle is dan herskryd in variational form wat gebruik gaan word vir die res van die verhandeling. Modal analysis word ook in chapter 1 verduidelik in hand vn 'n voorbeeld.\\

 In Chapter 2 word die werk van die artikel [VV02] gebruik om na die existence and uniqueness of solutions van second order hyperbolic equations te kyk. Die cantilever beam word as 'n voorbeeld gebruik om die werk te verduidelik.\\
 
 Chapter 3 kyk na die convergence van die FEM. Dit volg die werk van die artikel [XX]. Die methode van die artikel is om error estimates vir die fully discrete vartiational problem (Galerkin Approximation) te bepaal. In die tweede deel van chapter 3, word daar na die convergence van die eigenvalues en eigenvectors in die FEM gekyk. Dit volg die werk van die handboek [XX] en word in beter notation oorgeskryf.\\
 
 Chapter 4 fokus op the Timoshenko beam. Eerste word daar gekyk na die eigenvalue problem van die Timoshenko beam theory. Die artikel [VV06] gee die nodige werk om die eigenvalues en eigenvectors exactly uit te werk. Die methode word dan op 'n free-free beam en ook 'n cantilever beam toe gepas waar die eiewaarde uitgewerk word en ook die eigenfunctions geskets word. Daar is dan navorsing gedoen deur [SP06] wat gekyk het hoe goed 'n Timoshenko beam theory vergelyk met 'n 3D en 'n regte balk. Die navorsing wys dat die Timoshenko goed vergelyk die die regte balk in 'n free-free configuration. Die navorsing van [SP06] word discuss en gebruik dit as motiveering vir verdere numeriese simulation. Laaste deel in chapter 4 is 'n voorbeeld van 'n Timoshenko beam in 'n model wat meer real world application het. Dit is in die tegniese report van [XX]. Die werk in die chapter oor die tip body balk is net gefokus op die numeriese simulation.\\
 
 Chapter 5 gaan oor die plaat model. Die chapter doen die FEM analiese van die cantilever model. Die chapter le oook die reference configuration uit vir 'n rectangular plate model en adress die shear correction factor. Kan moontlik deel word van die volgende chapter.\\
 
 Chapter 6 is dieselfde as die vorige chapter Die chapter hanteer die FEM analise vir die twee en drie dimensionele elastic bodies. Die reference configuration is vir 'n rectangular form vir beide sodat dit later gebruik kan word indie volgende chapter. Die chapter gee ook die eigenvalue problems en wys wys dat die regte accuracy kan obtained word die die eiewaardes numeries uit te werk.\\
 
 Die laaste chapter hanteer die hoof numeriese werk van die verhandeling. Die die chapter word die validityvna die timoshenko beam asook die plaat model ondersoek. Eerste word die timoshenko beam met 'n twee-D beam vergelyk. Die is dieselfde as die artikel [XX]. So dieselfde werk word gedoen as die artikel, maar met aner waardes. Die werk word dan extend deur die twee-D model te vergelyk met die 3D model. Die modelle is elastic bodies, so daar work ook apart na die beam-type en non-beam type dele gekyk. Die eiewaardes word vergelyk met verskillende diktes va die 3D model en dan word daar gekyk na die eiefunksies se forms. Dan
