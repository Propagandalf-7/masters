\section{Summary}

\subsubsection{Chapter 1}
This dissertation is a literature study that investigates the validity of different linear models. The term validity in this dissertation means how well a model compares to a more realistic model for real world applications. The first chapter of the dissertation introduces the models. The main model is the Timoshenko beam theory. The other models are a two-dimensional elastic model, a three-dimensional elastic model and a Reissner-Mindlin plate model. The goal of this disseration to validate the use of the Timoshenko beam model and the Reissner-Mindlin plate model in applications. These models are simplified one-dimensional beam and two-dimensional plate models. But more realistic models exists, such as a two-dimensional and three-dimensional beam model and a three-dimensional plate model. Using modal analysis, it is shown that the solutions of the models can be represented as a linear combination of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Therefore it is only required to compare the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the models to determine the difference of the solutions. 

\subsubsection{Chapter 2}
In this section, the existence and solutions for a general vibration problem is investigated. The main article that is discussed is \cite{VV02}. In this article, the authors define a general vibration problem. The authors state four assumptions that need to be satified. Under these four assumptions, it can be shown that for the general vibration problem there exists a linear operator A, which is an infinitesimal generator of a $C_0$-semigroup of contractions with a domain in the problem space. This operator allows the general vibration problem to be rewritten as a system of first order differential equations $\displaystyle x' = Ax + f$. This differential equations are rewritten into an initial value problem which can be proven using semi-group theory to have a unique solution. The authors then provide the necessary proofs to show that a solution of the initial value problem is also a solution of the general vibration problem. An example of the application of this theory is provided using a cantilever Timoshenko beam.

\subsubsection{Chapter 3}
In this chapter, some theory for the Finite Element Method is discussed. This chapter contains two parts, that covers two different results. The first result is the convergence of the Galerkin approximation of a general vibration problem. This result is presented in the article \cite{BV13}. The second result concerns the convergence of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a one-dimensional vibration problem when applying the Finite Element Method. This result is presented in the textbook \cite{SF97}. In the first section, the authors continue with the general vibration problem that is used in chapter 2. The general vibration problem has a solution as shown in chapter 2. The Galerkin Approximation is derived from the general vibration probelm and is rewritten into a system of ordinary differential using the Finite Element Method. This oridinary differential equation can be proven to have a unique solution. The main results of \cite{BV13} shows that this solution of the Galerkin Approximation converges to the solution of the general vibration problem. The approach of the authors is to calculate the error estimates. The error is split into two parts, a semi-discrete and a fully discrete problem. Two assumptions are added to the assumptions from chapter 2. Using these assumptions, the authors obtain error estimates for the semi-discrete and fully discrete problems.

The second part of the chapter considers work done in a textbook \cite{SF97}.

\section{Overview}

\subsubsection{Comparison of models}
The first chapter introduces the models used in this dissertation. The models are of different dimensions. The first model is a three dimensional elastic body. The model problems for the three-dimensional body is a cantilever and a free-free body. A general case of plane stress is also discussed. Making assumptions on plane stress, results into a two-dimensional model. This model is a special case of plane stress. For the one-dimensional case, the Timoshenko beam theory is considered. Four different models problems are used in this disseration. These model problems are a cantilever, a free-free beam, a pinned-pinned beam and a suspended beam. Lastly a Reissner Mindlin plate theory is considered. The model problems for the plate theory are a cantilever plate and a rigidly clamped plate. For each of the models problems, the boundary conditions are presented and the variational form is derived. The variational form of each problem is mainly used in this dissertation. (ROD THEORY?)

\subsubsection{Mathematical analysis of vibration problems}

This chapter is a discussion and example of application of the theory presented in the article \cite{VV02}. This article concerns the existence and uniqueness of solutions of second order hyperbolic type problems. The models in this dissertation are such problems. In the article \cite{VV02}, the authors define a general variational problem on specific Hilbert spaces. To obtain the main results of the article, four assumptions are made. The results include existence and uniqueness of solutions for strong and weak damped models. The models in this dissertation are all weakly damped. The general variational problem is rewritten for a first order system of differential equations. This system is defined on a Hilbert space $H$. A operator $A$ is defined, and using the assumptions the authors prove that the operator $A$ is an infinitesimal generator of a $C_0$-semigroup of contractions with a domain in $H$. Using this operator the authors rewrite the system of differential into the form $\displaystyle x' = Ax + f$. To be more precise, the system of first order system of differential equations can be written as an initial value problem. The existence and uniqueness results for the first order system is easily proven with an initial value problem. The authors also prove that a solution of the first order system is also a solution to the general variational problem. Using semi-group theory, a unique solution for the initial value problem can be proved. The authors also provide the link between the solutions of the initial value problem and the general variational form. Thus proving the required results. As an example to apply the theory, a cantilever Timoshenko beam is used. The weak variational form is derived. In this weak variational form, the product spaces can be made complete. The four assumptions of \cite{VV02} is then proved to hold for the example. (Modal Analysis ?)

\subsubsection{Finite element theory}

In this chapter, two convergence results relating to the Finite Element Method are discussed. The first result is the convergence of the Galerkin approximation for vibration problems. This is presented in the article \cite{BV13.} For this result, the general variational form of chapter 2 is used. The Galerkin approximation of this general variational problem can be derived, as well as an initial value problem using the standard Finite Element Analysis matrices. The article \cite{BV13} derive an error estimate for the solution of the general vartiational problem and the solution to it's Galerkin approximation. To obtain this error estimate, the authors make two assumptions, and split the problem into a semi-discrete and a fully discrete problem. Following the assumptions, the authors prove error estimates for the semi-dicrete and the fully-discrete problem.\\ 

The second result concerns the convergence of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions with the Finite Element Method for one-dimensional vibration problems. This is a result form the textbook \cite{SF97}.**********


\subsubsection{Timoshenko beam model}

Tis chapter explores the idea of the Timoshenko beam theory further. The article \cite{VV06} presents a method of finding the exact eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for a Timoshenko beam. The method uses modal analysis to solve a general eigenvalue problem. This results in three different cases of possible solutions for the general eigenvalue problem. Using these cases, the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be calculated. The authors also present some examples. Two examples are verified in this chapter. The cantilever and free-free beam. For both the eigenvalues are calculated and compared to the results of \cite{VV06}. Some examples of modal shapes are also graphed. The idea of a suspended beam is breifly discussed. Next the article \cite{SP06} is discussed. In this section, the authors obtain eigenvalues of a free-free Timoshenko beam by vibrating and measuring the natural frequencies of a real beam. This empirical data is then compared to the theoretical results of various methods, including the Finite Element Method. In this last section, a example of the application of the Timoshenko beam model is presented. This section is a study of a technical report. In this report, the authors present a model for a cantilever Timoshenko beam with a tip body and elastic interfaces. This section also expands the numerical results of the report. The variational form of the model is derived, and the Galerkin approximation follows. The Mixed Finite Element Method is applied to the model. Using the Finite Element Method, the solution of the model is numerically calculated. Various results are given for different values of the parameters. The numerical results and figures confirms that the model behaves as expected. 

\subsubsection{Finite element method}
This chapter is preperation for the final chapter in this dissertation. The finite element method is applied to the models of this dissertation. Specifically, it is applied to the Cantilever model problem of the three-dimensional and two-dimensional elastic bosies, as well as the cantilever plate model. The cantilever Timoshenko beam model is excluded since chapter 4 provides an exact method to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Each of the models are assumed to have a rectangular cross-section and is made of the same isotropic material. For each model, a reference configuration is defined. The Galerkin approximation can then be derived and using the Finite Element Method, a system of oridinary differential equations can be obatined. At this point is it easy to derive a eigenvalue problem for each of the models. This eigenvalue problem can be solved using numerical methods.

\subsubsection{Validity of cantilever beam and plate models}

In this chapter, the validity of the models in this dissertation is investigated using numerical results. Specifically the validity of a cantilever Timoshenko beam and a cantilever Reissner-Mindlin plate is investigated. In this case, the term validity refers to how well the model compares to a more realistic model. All models are assumed to have a rectangular cross-section, are in a cantilever configuration and are made of the same isotropic material. The first section, is a discussion of the article \cite{LVV09}. In this article, the authors investigate the validity of the Timoshenko beam model. The authors compare the Timoshenko beam model to a more realistic two-dimensional beam model. The comparison is made with the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. From modal analysis it is known that the solution of the models are linear combinations of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. The two-dimensional model also have eigenvalues that do not have a corresponding eigenvalue in the Timoshenko beam model. The authors call all matching eigenvalues beam-type eigenvalues. The authors show that the Timoshenko beam model compare well to the two-dimensional model for long and short beams. The results of the article are verified and extra results are also calculated for the rest of this chapter. In this section, the aricle \cite{LVV09} is extended to verify the validity of the two-dimensional elastic model. The two-dimensional elastic model is compared to a more realistic three-dimensional model. The two dimensional model serves as a intermediate step between the Timoshenko beam model and the three-dimensional model. The same approach of \cite{LVV09} is used to compare the two models. The result show that the two-dimensional model compare very well to the three-dimensional model, especially for beam problems. The last section takes the idea of \cite{LVV09} and extends it to the Reissner-Mindlin plate model. The Reissner-Mindlin plate model is compared to a more realistic three-dimensional plate model.\\

\section{Mathematical analysis of vibration problems}

This chapter is a discussion and example of application of the theory presented in the article \cite{VV02}. This article concerns the existence and uniqueness of solutions of second order hyperbolic type problems. The models in this dissertation as such problems.\\

This chapter also concerns the idea of modal analysis. This is a method to find the natural frequencies of a system. This method is used later in the dissertation.

\subsection{Existence and uniqueness of solutions}
This section is a discussion of the theory presented in the article \cite{VV02}.

\subsubsection{The variational approach}

The authors define a general variational problem. This problem is defined on specific Hilbert spaces. Four assumptions are made in the article as well as some notation introduced.

\subsubsection{Main results for existence and uniqueness}
The main results of the article are given in this section. The results include existence and uniqueness of solutions for strong and weak damped models. The models in this dissertation are all weakly damped. 

\subsubsection{First order system}
To prove the results, the approach of the authors are as follows.\\

The general variational problem is rewritten for a first order system of differential equations. This system is defined on a Hilbert space $H$. A operator $A$ is defined, and using the assumptions the authors prove that the operator $A$ is an infinitesimal generator of a $C_0$-semigroup of contractions with a domain in $H$.\\

Using this operator the authors rewrite the system of differential into the form $\displaystyle x' = Ax + f$. To be more precise, the system of first order system of differential equations can be written as an initial value problem.\\

The existence and uniqueness results for the first order system is easily proven with an initial value problem. The authors also prove that a solution of the first order system is also a solution to the general variational problem.\\

Using semi-group theory, a unnique solution for the initial value problem can be proved. The authors also provide the link between the solutions of the initial value problem and the general variational form. Thus proving the required results.

\subsection{Application: Timoshenko beam model}

\section{Finite element theory}

\subsection{Convergence of the Galerkin approximation}
In this Chapter, two convergence results related to the Finite Element Method is presented. This first result is the convergence of the Galerkin approximation of a second order hyperbolic type problem, presented in the article \cite{BV13}.\\

The second result concerns the convergence of the eigenvalue and eigenfunctions of a one-dimensional second order hyperbolic type problem when applying the Finite Element Method. This is presented in the textbook \cite{SF97}.

\subsubsection{Galerkin approximation}
In this section, the authors use the same general variational problem as presented in \cite{VV02} (Chapter 2). The authors assume that this general variational problem has a unique solution.\\

To start, the Galerkin approximation for the general variational problem is derived. The a unique solution is proved in \cite{BV13} when the forcing function $f$ is continuous.\\

\subsubsection{System of ordinary differential equations}

Using the Finite Element Method matrices, the Galerkin approximation is rewritten as a system of ordinary differential equations.

\subsubsection{Error estimates}
Given that $u$ is a solution of the general variational problem, and $u^h$ is a solution to the Galerkin approximation, the authors define the error $e^h = u - u^h$.\\

The in \cite{BV13} the authors prove that this error can be made arbitrarily small by choosing a sufficiently small $h$, such that $u^h \rightarrow u$ as $h \rightarrow 0$. \cite{BV18} extends \cite{BV13} to include damping.\\


To obtain the error estimate, the authors split the error into two parts. The first part is a semi-dicrete problem and the second is a discrete problem. These two problems are investigated seperately.

Die methode word dan op 'n free-free beam en ook 'n cantilever beam toe gepas waar die eiewaarde uitgewerk word en ook die eigenfunctions geskets word. Daar is dan navorsing gedoen deur [SP06] wat gekyk het hoe goed 'n Timoshenko beam theory vergelyk met 'n 3D en 'n regte balk. Die navorsing wys dat die Timoshenko goed vergelyk die die regte balk in 'n free-free configuration. Die navorsing van [SP06] word discuss en gebruik dit as motiveering vir verdere numeriese simulation. Laaste deel in chapter 4 is 'n voorbeeld van 'n Timoshenko beam in 'n model wat meer real world application het. Dit is in die tegniese report van [XX]. Die werk in die chapter oor die tip body balk is net gefokus op die numeriese simulation.\\
 
 Chapter 5 gaan oor die plaat model. Die chapter doen die FEM analiese van die cantilever model. Die chapter le oook die reference configuration uit vir 'n rectangular plate model en adress die shear correction factor. Kan moontlik deel word van die volgende chapter.\\
 
 Chapter 6 is dieselfde as die vorige chapter Die chapter hanteer die FEM analise vir die twee en drie dimensionele elastic bodies. Die reference configuration is vir 'n rectangular form vir beide sodat dit later gebruik kan word indie volgende chapter. Die chapter gee ook die eigenvalue problems en wys wys dat die regte accuracy kan obtained word die die eiewaardes numeries uit te werk.\\
 
 Die laaste chapter hanteer die hoof numeriese werk van die verhandeling. Die die chapter word die validityvna die timoshenko beam asook die plaat model ondersoek. Eerste word die timoshenko beam met 'n twee-D beam vergelyk. Die is dieselfde as die artikel [XX]. So dieselfde werk word gedoen as die artikel, maar met aner waardes. Die werk word dan extend deur die twee-D model te vergelyk met die 3D model. Die modelle is elastic bodies, so daar work ook apart na die beam-type en non-beam type dele gekyk. Die eiewaardes word vergelyk met verskillende diktes va die 3D model en dan word daar gekyk na die eiefunksies se forms. Dan
